The library allows the developer to scan for nearby iBeacon devices in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Return a list of all nearby iBeacon devices, regardless of their UUID.\r\n2. Return only information on iBeacon devices from pre-determined Beacon Regions. You can monitor and range these regions, in a method very similar to that used in iOS. \r\n \r\nThere are 4 classes, the one that you will interact most with is the GCellBeaconScanManager\r\nThis class handles the Bluetooth scans and returns any scanned devices in range that have an appropriate advertising packet. E.g., once initialized and running it returns callbacks based on what beacons are ranged. This are returned every 1 second in the form of an array list. \r\n\r\nBeacons are flushed from the list if they haven’t been seen for x seconds, as defined by setBeaconAutoRefreshRate, this defaults to 10s to match iOS. During this interval the RSSI of any beacon that may have just gone out of range is set to 0 and proximity unknown.\r\n\r\n### Java Documentation & Overview\r\nFor Java documentation please see the repository [docs](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-pugh-gcell/GCellBeaconScanner_Android/master/GCellBeaconDocs/index.html).\r\n\r\n###Compatibility\r\nThe library is designed and tested to work with Android 4.3 (API Level 18) onwards. This API introduces built-in platform support for Bluetooth Low Energy to scan and discover devices. \r\n\r\n# Using the Library\r\n\r\n##Adding the Library to your Project\r\n1. Download and Copy the **gcellbeaconscanlibrary-release-vX.aar** file into the libs folder in your Android Studio Project.\r\n2. Within your app build.gradle file add the following entry to allow the app to see the library locally\r\n\r\n````xml\r\n  repositories {\r\n        flatDir{\r\n            dirs 'libs'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\n3. and add the aar as a dependency\r\n\r\n````xml\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile(name:'gcellbeaconscanlibrary-release-v1-01', ext: 'aar')\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n##Setting Permissions\r\nIn order to detect beacons your app will need to have manifest permission to access to Bluetooth and your location. To enable these permissions add the following entries to the AndroidManifest.xml file in your app. \r\n\r\n````xml\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\"/>\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.BLUETOOTH\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN\" />\r\n````\r\nThe library will automatically check for user permissions and the status of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) on the device and is compatible with Marshmallow. \r\n\r\n## Import the class definitions\r\n\r\n````java\r\nimport com.gcell.ibeacon.gcellbeaconscanlibrary.GCellBeaconManagerScanEvents;\r\nimport com.gcell.ibeacon.gcellbeaconscanlibrary.GCellBeaconRegion;\r\nimport com.gcell.ibeacon.gcellbeaconscanlibrary.GCellBeaconScanManager;\r\nimport com.gcell.ibeacon.gcellbeaconscanlibrary.GCelliBeacon;\r\nimport com.gcell.ibeacon.gcellbeaconscanlibrary.GCellUuid;\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Implement GCellBeaconManagerScanEvents interface and Implement methods\r\n````java\r\n public class MainActivity extends Activity implements GCellBeaconManagerScanEvents{\r\n````\r\n\r\n````java\r\n\t // region Handle BeaconScanManager Events\r\n\r\n\t // This event means the scan manager has updated the ranged beacon list\r\n\t public void onGCellUpdateBeaconList(List<GCelliBeacon> disc_gcell_beacons) {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"Beacons found: \" + disc_gcell_beacons.size());\r\n\t }\r\n\r\n\t // This event means the device has enetred a beacon region. To find out more about what beacons are in the region, start ranging.\r\n\t // This will return beacon UUID, Major, Minor and RSSI values\r\n\t public void didEnterBeaconRegion(GCellBeaconRegion region) {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"Entered region: \" + region.toString());\r\n\t\t mbtManager.startRangingforRegion(region);\r\n\t }\r\n\r\n\t // The device has exited a region, we can now stop ranging for that region to save battery\r\n\t public void didExitBeaconRegion(GCellBeaconRegion region) {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"Exited region: \" + region.toString());\r\n\t\t mbtManager.stopRangingforRegion(region);\r\n\t }\r\n\r\n\t // Beacons within a region have been ranged - we now have a list of beacons and their values\r\n\t public void didRangeBeaconsinRegion(GCellBeaconRegion region, List<GCelliBeacon> disc_gcell_beacons) {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"Beacons found in region: \" + disc_gcell_beacons.size() + \" \" + region.toString());\r\n\r\n\t }\r\n\r\n\t // The user has denied permission for coarse location.\r\n\t public void locationPermissionsDenied(){\r\n\t\t mbtManager.stopScanningForBeacons();\r\n\t }\r\n\r\n\t // Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is not supported for this device\r\n\t public void bleNotSupported() {\r\n\r\n\t }\r\n\r\n\t // BLE is not on for this device\r\n\t public void bleNotEnabled() {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"BLE not enabled\");\r\n\r\n\t }\r\n\t// endregion\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Add Permission Handler for Android 6.0\r\nIn order to detect and use beacons, your app needs to have location permissions granted. As of Android 6.0 (API level 23) this is classed as a 'Dangerous' permission and as such the user has to explicitly give approval to your app. The GCellBeaconScanManager library automatically checks and, if required, requests the appropriate location permissions in Marshmallow. In order to handle this request properly you need to implement a *onRequestPermissionResult* method in your Activity. This just calls the *permissionResult* method in the GCellBeaconScanManager Library which will deal with the values. The GCellBeaconScanManager Library requests permissions with a requestCode value of 1. If you need to request additional permissions in your project, either use a requestCode value greater than 1 or change the code the library uses by changing the value of  *coarseLocationRequestcode*.\r\n\r\n````java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String permissions[], int[] grantResults) {\r\n         //Check to see if this is feedback from the request that the Scan manager made by checking the requestCode\r\n         if(requestCode == mbtManager.getPermissionRequestCode()) {\r\n             mbtManager.handlePermissionResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);\r\n         }else{\r\n             //This wasnt a response to the Scan Manager permission another request, handle accordingly\r\n             Log.i(TAG,\"This was another request\");\r\n         }\r\n\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n#Using the library\r\nNow the set up is complete, its time to start using the library. The first task is to create an instance object of GCellBeaconScanmanager\r\nDeclare a GCellBeaconScanmanager as an instance variable:\r\n````java\r\nprivate GCellBeaconScanManager mbtManager;\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen create an instance within the onCreate method of your Activity:\r\n\r\n````java\r\n\t\t// set up scan manager\r\n\t\tmbtManager = new GCellBeaconScanManager(this);\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to use the library:\r\n\r\n## Scanning for Regions\r\nThis method will be familar to anyone who has used iBeacon within iOS. Beacon regions are defined and information about whether you are within these regions and what beacons that correspond to that region are returned. \r\nTo use this method, set the *useBeaconRegions* to true.\r\n````java\r\n\t\t//use known regions\r\n\t\tmbtManager.useBeaconRegions(true);\r\n````\r\n### Defining a Beacon region\r\nRegions represent the area a user can be in if they can see one or more beacons within range. You can use this capability to generate alerts or to provide other relevant information when the user enters or exits a beacon region. Rather than being identified by fixed geographical coordinates, a beacon region is identified by the device’s proximity to Bluetooth low-energy beacons that advertise a combination of the following values:\r\n\r\n<li>A proximity UUID (universally unique identifier), which is a 128-bit value that uniquely identifies one or more beacons as a certain type or from a certain organization or project\r\n<li>A major value, which is a 16-bit unsigned integer that can be used to group related beacons that have the same proximity UUID\r\n<li>A minor value, which is a 16-bit unsigned integer that differentiates beacons with the same proximity UUID and major value.\r\n\r\nBeacon regions can be defined by their proximity UUID only, Proximity UUID and Major number or by the proximity UUID, Major and Minor Numbers. This gives developers flexibility in how they define iBeacon projects and infastructure. The GCellBeaconRegion class has a number of constructures corresponding to these different definitions, but you can also automatically define a region based on the default GCell UUID.\r\n\r\n````java\r\nGCellBeaconRegion gCellRegion = new GCellBeaconRegion(); //Sending no parameters initiates a region using the Default GCell UUID\r\nGCellBeaconRegion otherRegion = new GCellBeaconRegion(new GCellUuid(\"6953fD4f-cfAF-ff58-a9cf-574A5E383c24\"), \"com.other\");\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen just add these regions to the manager as an ArrayList\r\n\r\n````java\r\n\t private ArrayList<GCellBeaconRegion> beaconRegions = new ArrayList<GCellBeaconRegion>();\r\n\t \t....\r\n\t beaconRegions.add(gCellRegion);\r\n\tmbtManager.setBeaconRegions(beaconRegions);\r\n````\r\nThen just start monitoring for these regions.\r\n\t\t\r\n````java\r\n\tmbtManager.startMonitoringForBeacons();\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe library will monitor for BLE devices in low power mode; if any iBeacon devices are in range that correspond to the Beacon Regions defined, the library will call the *didEnterRegion* method. To start to get more details of the beacons in that region, then call the *startMonitoringForBeaconinRegion* method.\r\n\r\n````java\r\n\t// This event means the device has enetred a beacon region. To find out more about what beacons are in the region, start ranging.\r\n\t // This will return beacon UUID, Major, Minor and RSSI values\r\n\tpublic void didEnterBeaconRegion(GCellBeaconRegion region) {\r\n\t mbtManager.startRangingforRegion(region);\r\n\t}\r\n````\r\n\t \r\n Details of the iBeacon devices in range will then be returned via the \r\n````java\r\n\t \t // Beacons within a region have been ranged - we now have a list of beacons and their values\r\n\t public void didRangeBeaconsinRegion(GCellBeaconRegion region, List<GCelliBeacon> disc_gcell_beacons) {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"Beacons found in region: \" + disc_gcell_beacons.size() + \" \" + region.toString());\r\n\t }\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Scanning for all iBeacon Devices\r\nYou can also scan and return a list of all nearby iBeacon devices regardless of their UUID, Major and Minor settings. In this case set *useBeaconRegions* to false and just start scanning \r\n````java\r\nmbtManager.useBeaconRegions(false);\r\nmbtManager.startScanningForBeacons();\r\n````\r\nThis method of operation can be easier to set up, but can be more power hungry and can also leave you with a large list of beacon devices that you then have to manage yourself. These will be returned via * onGCellUpdateBeaconList*.\r\n````java\r\n\t public void onGCellUpdateBeaconList(List<GCellBleDevice> disc_gcell_beacons) {\r\n\t\t Log.i(TAG, \"Beacons found: \" + disc_gcell_beacons.size());\r\n\t }\r\n````\r\n## Fine tuning the Library\r\nYou can configure some of the default settings of the library as outlined below and in the documentation. \r\n````java\r\n\r\n        // Switch debug to true to get feedback from the library during development via Log.i\r\n        mbtManager.enableDeuggingFeedback(true);\r\n        // Set the library to automatically switch BLE on if it is off or switched off, default is true\r\n        mbtManager.enableBlueToothAutoSwitchOn(true);\r\n        // Set the auto-refresh rate to 10 s - this is the time we will go without seeing a beacon before deleting it from the ranged list. Default is 8s\r\n        mbtManager.setBeaconAutoRefreshRate(10);\r\n\r\n        //Set the message to display when showing information dialog before requesting permissions to access users location\r\n        mbtManager.setPermissionExplanationMessage(\"Example Feedback Message. We need permission sto see your location before we can see beacons!\");\r\n        // Set the requestCode used to Request Grant Permissions - default is 1\r\n        mbtManager.setPermissionRequestCode(24);\r\n````\r\n",
